Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Syna3C backend repository! :tada: :tada:

## Issues

### I think I've discovered a bug
If you experience unexpected behaviour on the production site [syna3c.org](https://syna3c.org) or the developer site [dev.syna3c.org](https://dev.syna3c.org)

1. Check whether it's a bug in the frontend or the backend code (TODO: How?)
2. Check the [issues](https://github.com/Syna3C/backend/issues) to see if it's already been reported.
3. **If it has already been reported**, check if your case provides any additional information on the issue that might be helpful to the developers.
   - Did you notice the bug on a different platform than the one(s) mentioned in the bug report?
   - Were you able to reproduce the bug in a different way?
4. If your bug information seems relevant to the issue, please leave a comment with a brief description, list of steps to reproduce, and your platform information (production site vs developer site, operating system and version, browser and version).
5. If your bug information is exactly the same as in the bug description, add a +1 reaction on the issue. This will help the developers recognize that it is a commonly occuring bug and prioritize finding a fix. Avoid comments like "+1" and "I have the same issue" that add nothing to the discussion and send out unhelpful notifications to everyone involved in the discussion.
6. **If it has not been reported**, [create a new bug report issue](https://github.com/Syna3C/backend/issues/new?template=bug_report.md), filling out the template with a description of the bug, steps to reproduce, expected behaviour and information on your browser and OS, and anything else you think might be relevant to the issue.

### I'd like to make a feature request

1. Determine the right repository - [frontend](https://github.com/Syna3C/frontend) for purely visual changes, [backend](https://github.com/Syna3C/backend) for changes to the API, or both, if the feature encompasses both.
2. [Create a new feature request issue](https://github.com/Syna3C/backend/issues/new?template=feature_request.md), filling out the template with a description of the problem your feature would address, the details of the solution you'd like to see, and any other information that might be relevant to the issue.
3. A core contributor will review your feature request and mark it as accepted if it aligns with the roadmap (TODO: Link to project roadmap) of the project, or close the issue with an explanatory comment if it seems outside the scope of the project.

Please note that as a volunteer-led effort, Syna3C may not be able to fix bugs or implement your feature request right away.
